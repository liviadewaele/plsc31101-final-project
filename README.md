## Short Description

In this project, I created an introduction to LaTeX for beginners. I used an R markdown file to create a PDF document that goes takes people through the basics and introduces a number of useful things that can be done in LaTeX. I integrated chunks of Latex code into the R markdown file. Some of these chunks illustrated how to write LaTeX code and did not create an output. Other chunks did create an output, to show what the finished product would look like. 

## Dependencies

List what software your code depends on, as well as version numbers, like so:.

1. R, Version 3.6.1
- knitr::include_graphics()

2. LaTeX, Version 2.13.2 (2.13.2)
-  usepackage{graphicx}



## Files

#### Code/
1.Latex_Presentation_LD.tex: The LaTeX code for my lightning presentation. (This has created a number of related files: .aux, .log, .nav, .out, .snm, .gz, .toc, .vrb. //
2. lateximage.png: The image that I use in my presentation to show what some 'complete' LaTeX code looks like. //
3. LaTeX_Project_LD.Rmd: The R markdown code for the PDF document that I created to teach people about LaTeX. 

#### Teaching_Materials/
1. Latex_Presentation_LD.pdf: My lightning talk slides which introduce LaTeX in a shortened format. Created using LaTeX.
2. LaTeX_Project_LD.pdf: The full document which takes people through what LaTeX is and how they can use it. Created using R markdown.


## More Information

More information about how to use LaTeX is included in links that I provide at the end of my presentation and full length PDF document.
